## Why I started this blog

I started this blog because I need a place to express some thoughts to the world. Why don't I just make Linkedin or Twitter posts? Why go back to this ancient format when social media exists? It's the same reason I created a Flickr account in the place of my Instagram account. Because social media sucks. I hate having Instagram, Reddit, and everything else on my phone. I always catch myself scrolling brainlessly while I could be doing something else. All the hours I spend each week contributing to my brain-fog and ultimately feeling ungrounded from my friends and family. So I'm not going to post there anymore. Instead I'll post here, where I can control everything about it, where my unfiltered thoughts can be platformed for whoever stumbles across my page. I'll still have my social media accounts, but they'll be linked here, where people who are interested have a central place to learn more about me. Part of me feels a little egotistical to have a whole website about myself. But this used to be the norm, right? Maybe I'm too used to social media. Here goes!
